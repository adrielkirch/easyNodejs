Node.js streams have been part of the language since its inception, generally used for on-demand data processing. JavaScript wasn't designed to handle large data volumes all at once. For instance, trying to process a 2GB memory load at once would result in memory overflow issues on your server. Node.js streams are employed in cases where processing large data volumes on demand is needed.

    Download of Large Files on Demand:
    Streams allow sending data to the client as it's being read from the disk, instead of loading the entire file into server memory before sending. This saves server memory and speeds up the download.

    Processing of Large CSV Reports:
    Rather than loading an entire CSV file into memory for processing, streams enable processing line by line, reducing memory usage and starting data processing more quickly.

    Real-time Data Streaming:
    Streams facilitate real-time data transmission from server to client, useful in IoT dashboards or real-time data analysis systems. Data is sent as it's generated, without waiting for all data to be generated first.

    Upload of Large Files:
    Streams enable processing of large files while they're being uploaded, ensuring the server can start processing the file as soon as the first bytes are received.

    Machine Learning Model Training:
    Streams efficiently handle large datasets for training ML models, avoiding memory overload by processing data incrementally.

    Example: Processing Terabyte-sized Video:
    Processing a terabyte-sized video file at once would overwhelm Node.js. Instead, using streams, the video is processed in chunks as it's received, enabling compression, format conversion, and saving to the cloud incrementally.

In streams, the video is first transformed into a buffer, a temporary memory area. The buffer is then divided into smaller chunks, allowing for incremental and efficient processing without overwhelming the server memory.

Transform Streams allow modifying data during transfer, like format conversion or data filtering. 

Writable Streams enable writing data to a destination asynchronously, such as a file or database. 

Readable Streams allow reading data from a source asynchronously, like a file or HTTP request.
