Socket.IO and WebSocket (often referred to as "ws") are both technologies used for real-time communication between a client and a server in web applications. 
While they serve similar purposes, they have some key differences:

    WebSocket (ws):
        WebSocket is a communication protocol providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection.
        It is standardized by the IETF as RFC 6455.
        WebSocket is a lower-level protocol compared to Socket.IO, providing a basic communication channel without built-in features like automatic reconnection, multiplexing, or fallback mechanisms.
        WebSocket is supported by most modern web browsers and can be used with various programming languages and frameworks on both the client and server sides.

    Socket.IO:
        Socket.IO is a JavaScript library that enables real-time, bidirectional, and event-based communication between web clients and servers.
        It builds on top of WebSocket but provides additional features and fallback mechanisms to ensure compatibility with a wide range of browsers and network configurations.
        Socket.IO automatically handles features like reconnection, multiplexing, and support for various transports (WebSocket, AJAX long polling, etc.) transparently, providing a more robust and flexible solution for real-time communication.
        Socket.IO also provides a higher-level API compared to raw WebSocket, making it easier to work with events and data.

In summary, while WebSocket is a lower-level protocol providing a basic communication channel, Socket.IO is a higher-level library built on top of WebSocket that adds additional features and abstraction to simplify real-time communication in web applications and ensure compatibility across different environments. 
Socket.IO is often preferred for its ease of use and robustness in real-world applications.
