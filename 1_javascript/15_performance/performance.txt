Static Code Analysis (QA):
    Evaluation of source code quality without executing it.
    Tools such as linters, static code analyzers, and automated inspections.
    Identifies potential problems such as coding bad practices, style violations, logic bugs, etc.
    Helps maintain consistent coding standards and avoid common errors.

Dynamic Code Analysis (Performance):
    Monitoring and identification of performance issues during code execution.
    Use of profiling tools such as APM Node.js, Autocannon, 0x
    Detects performance bottlenecks, memory leaks, excessive resource consumption, among others.
    Allows optimizing code performance and ensuring a smoother user experience.

External Connections Analysis:
    Evaluation of integration with external systems, such as APIs and databases.
    Verification of security, reliability, and efficiency of connections.
    May include load and stress testing to simulate behavior under extreme conditions.
    Ensures that the application functions consistently and effectively in its production environment.

Documentation / Report:
    Detailed documentation of all analyses performed and their results.
    Reports that highlight identified problems, their causes, and possible solutions.
    Records of performance metrics and quality standards over time.
    Facilitates communication between teams and helps in decision-making regarding improvements and corrections.

Suggestions for Improvement and/or Implementation:
    Recommendations for addressing identified issues in static and dynamic analyses.
    Suggestions for performance optimization, code refactoring, and enhancement of integration with external systems.
    Prioritization of improvements based on the severity of issues and the potential impact on users and the system as a whole.

Observability suggestion combo:

    Prometheus: As mentioned earlier, Prometheus is a powerful time-series database and monitoring system. 
    It excels at collecting and storing metrics from various sources, including your application, system metrics, and any other services you're using. 
    Prometheus provides powerful querying capabilities with PromQL, allowing you to analyze and visualize your data effectively.

    OpenTelemetry: OpenTelemetry is a set of open-source APIs, libraries, agents, and instrumentation to provide observability for cloud-native software.
    It allows you to instrument your code to collect telemetry data such as traces, metrics, and logs. 
    By integrating OpenTelemetry with your applications, you can gain insights into their performance and behavior in real-time.

     Grafana: Grafana is a popular open-source platform for monitoring and observability. 
    It integrates seamlessly with Prometheus and provides a rich set of visualization options, including graphs, charts, and dashboards. 
    Grafana allows you to create customized dashboards to visualize performance metrics and trends, making it easier to identify issues and optimize your system's performance.
