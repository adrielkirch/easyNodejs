# Project Name

## What is Node.js?

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting—running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser.

## Why Use Node.js?

1. **Asynchronous event-driven IO**: Helps concurrent request handling – This is in contrast to today's more common concurrency model where OS threads are employed. Thread-based networking is relatively inefficient and very difficult to use.

2. **Superfast**: Built on Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine, Node.js library is very fast in code execution.

3. **Single Threaded but Highly Scalable**: Node.js uses a single threaded model with event looping.

4. **No Buffering**: Node.js applications never buffer any data. These applications simply output the data in chunks.

5. **License**: Node.js is released under the MIT license.
