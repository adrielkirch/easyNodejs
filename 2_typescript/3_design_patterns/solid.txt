Briefly introduce the concept of software design principles and their importance in creating high-quality, maintainable software.
Explain that SOLID is an acronym that represents five design principles for writing good, clean, and scalable object-oriented code.

SOLID Principles Overview (10 minutes):

    Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):
        Explain that a class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one responsibility.
        Provide examples of breaking down large, monolithic classes into smaller, focused classes with specific responsibilities.

    Open/Closed Principle (OCP):
        Describe that software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
        Show examples of how to achieve this through inheritance, composition, and the use of interfaces.

    Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):
        Define that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting the correctness of the program.
        Illustrate this principle with examples of polymorphism and interface implementations.

    Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):
        Explain that clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
        Demonstrate how to create small, focused interfaces tailored to specific client needs.

    Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):
        Introduce the concept of dependency inversion, where high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules but rather on abstractions.
        Show how to achieve this through dependency injection and inversion of control.
